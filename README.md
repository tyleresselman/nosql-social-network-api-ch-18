  # NoSQL Social Network API - Challenge 18

  ## Description: 
  Our challenge was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. We used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. I achieved much of the necessary functionality but not all of it. I am proud of the resourcefulness I was able to use in getting the structure of the app built. I think I'm growing, which feels good.

  ## Usage
  You may use my app by downloading the code from my github and starting the server with the command 'node server.js'. From there, you can see the functionality through the Insomnia interface.

  ## Contributions
  I took file/folder structure and Insomnia test templates from our instructors. I also pulled heavily from examples in our class assignments for the structure of the routes and controller functions. I collaborated with my classmates Matthew Bronstein, Jordan Harris, Leah Roman, and Joseph Ruiz on logic and conceptual elements for the app.
